Our submission for the 30th pyweek:
A small ship managment game called Pyrates! For more information about the game check the PyratesReadMeAvara.pdf


# Windows: 
To run this under windows you need pygame 2.0.0.dev6

    pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev6

Once that is installed you can just run the run_game.py file in the src folder and you 
are good to go!

# Mac OS
Under MacOS you will also need pygame 2.0.0.dev6 (tested with Python 3.7). Yet the aspect ratio seems to be messed up at times.

# Linux
not tested but likely to be similar to MacOS
